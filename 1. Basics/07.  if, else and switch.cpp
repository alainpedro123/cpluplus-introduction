1. if-else equivalent

if (x == 1) {
  cout << "x is 1";
}
else if (x == 2) {
  cout << "x is 2";
}
else {
  cout << "value of x unknown";
}



2. switch example

switch (x) {
  case 1:
    cout << "x is 1";
  case 2:
    cout << "x is 2";
  case 3:
    cout << "x is 3";
    break;

  default:
    cout << "x is not 1, 2 nor 3";
  }
